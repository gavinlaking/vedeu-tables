# Vedeu Tables

Vedeu (vee-dee-you; aka VDU) is my attempt at creating a terminal based
 application framework without the need for Ncurses. Please see [Vedeu](https://github.com/gavinlaking/vedeu). Vedeu Tables is a plugin for Vedeu which
 provides the means to transform you tabular data into a Vedeu view.


## Example

Coming soon!


## Documentation & Usage

Coming soon!


## Development / Contributing

* Documentation hosted at [RubyDoc](http://rubydoc.info/gems/vedeu-tables).
* Source hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/gavinlaking/vedeu-tables).

Pull requests are very welcome! Please try to follow these simple rules if
 applicable:

* Please create a topic branch for every separate change you make.
* Make sure your patches are well tested.
* Update the [Yard](http://yardoc.org/) documentation.
  (Use `yard stats --list-undoc` to locate undocumented code)
* Update the [README](https://github.com/gavinlaking/vedeu-tables/blob/master/README.md).
* Please **do not change** the version number.

Any branch on the repository that is not `master` is probably experimental; do
 not rely on anything in these branches. Typically, `twerks` will be merged
 into `master` before a release, and branches prefixed with `spike/` are me
 playing with ideas.
